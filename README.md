# `v2`

`v2` (also known as **Villamer and Valencia**) is a programming language designed specifically for configuration created and developed by [Cyril John Magayaga](https://github.com/magayaga). It was written in C programming language and can be **application settings**, **user preferences**, **data analysis**, and **more**. It was available for the **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** operating systems.

## Example code

   birthPlace = "Palacio de Pimentel, Valladolid, Crown of Castile"
